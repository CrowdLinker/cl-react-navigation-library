<Navigator>
  -- computes activeIndex based on location 
  -- pass activeIndex to tabs/stack
  -- set basepath context, navigate, and state to children (link / screen)

  <Headers>
    -- renders matching index only
    <Header>1</Header>
    <Header>2</Header>
    <Header>3</Header>
  </Headers>

  <Tabs / Stack>
    -- pager w/ screens 
    -- navigates to new location on gesture updates
    -- control mounting and visible screens based on activeIndex and props

    <Screen path='1' unmountOnExit lazy style={{ borderWidth: 1 }} />
      -- consumer components - control unmounting, mounting, and style
      -- receives active prop to indicate mounted state
      -- receives state, params, and navigate()

    <Screen path='2' /> 
    <Screen path='3' />
    
  </Tabs / Stack>

  <Tabbar>
    -- active tab highlighted 
    -- paths are mapped to screens based on order

    <Tab>1</Tab>
    <Tab>2</Tab>
    <Tab>3</Tab>
  </Tabbar>

</Navigator>

-- reduce the amount of consumers (might help w/ performance)
   - move path resolution into navigation (basepath / location used in links for navigate())

   - navigator needs location to compute active index 
   - screens need navigate and navigator state, location for params / query, set basepath context for children
   - link needs navigate function
